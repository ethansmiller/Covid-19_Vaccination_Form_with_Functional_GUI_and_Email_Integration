BASIC INFORMATION:
This program functions as a basic Covid-19 Vaccination patient information form. The main functionality serves as a way for medical staff to collect some basic information about the patient, and then schedule the two vaccination appointments 21 days apart from eachother. As information is entered, it is all saved into an excel file. When the appointment is made, an email is sent out to the exact email address provided which includes both the 1st and 2nd vaccination appointment dates. the program will also send a reminder email to the same address when the second appointment is 3 days away.

GUIDE:
When using this form, medical staff will first input the current date in the specific format of MM/DD/YY (USA standard 2 digit). The format for this entry is important as the current date is used by the program to detect if a reminder must be sent for the 2nd appointment. Next, the first name, middle name, and last name of the patient is gathered. This does not follow any format and even middle initial can be used. Next the date of birth will be entered in the format MM/DD/YYYY. This format is lenient as it is only stored in an excel file for reference and is not utilized by the program elsewhere. Next, phone number and email address are entered. The phone number serves as a secondary source of contact for the patient, but is not used in any sort of automatic messaging for reminders or confirmations. The email address, however, is the primary source of contact between medical staff and patient, and so should be formatted exactly as the email is written. This email will be used when sending confirmations and reminders. Finally, the first vaccination date is entered in the specified format of MM/DD/YY. Formatting is again important here as this format is used when calculating the 2nd appointment date 21 days later. When all information is entered, the confirmation button may be pressed and an email confirmation is sent, as well as all information is saved for use by the medical staff on the excel file. The excel file used is named "Vacc_info.xlsx", and must remain in the same folder as the program for it to run properly.

FURTHER INFORMATION:
This program utilizes tkinter for GUI implementation, openpyxl for excel interaction, datetime for calculating dates, and smtplib for formatting and sending emails. The program is basic as a majority of the code is for the designed GUI, while most if not all of the remaining code is implementation of the various libraries to provide necessary functions for checking dates, sending emails, saving to excel, etc... 

BUGS & FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
The current code precisely follows the criteria presented in the assignment, and so many of the inconsistencies of the program are due to a lack of time to commit to future development. Currently, there is only email functionality, with no option to have a text sent or call made to the designated phone number. For this reason, the phone number entry is not necessarily required but provides a secondary form of contact if the email is not correct. The formatting is very strict, and if not followed can result in common errors. Some of these errors include not using proper date formatting. In this case, no email will be sent, but all information entered will still be saved when the confirm button is pressed.
